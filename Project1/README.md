<p>Using the MNIST dataset (extracting 0's and 1's), I set up a Naive Bayes Classifier using average brightness and std. dev. of the brightness of each image as features.</p>
<p>From the training labeled set, I calculated the mean and variance of the different labels then created a normal distrution and found the probabilities of each test data.</p>
<p>Whichever probability was higher was the classification of my Classifier (more in-depth explaination is contained in the write up)</p>
